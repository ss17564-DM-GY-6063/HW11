## Drawing of the Finite State Machine for your password.
I chose a button, a potentiometer, and a photoresistor to create this **Password Machine.**

## Description of your logic and the correct steps necessary for a successful sequence.
### step 1
I studied the tutorial for the photoresistor and attempted to use it to control the brightness of a light. The green light would illuminate when the ambient brightness is insufficient. Upon successful implementation, I used an `else if` statement to control the red light.
### step 2
I added a button, which is a crucial factor in determining whether the green light should be illuminated.
### step 3
In the third step, utilizing the potentiometer we learned about in the previous class, I defined its value. By continuously turning it to the right, when the value exceeds 4000, it becomes the third condition.
The green light of the password lock will illuminate when all three conditions are met, indicating that the password lock has been successfully unlocked.

I wonder which app to draw the porcelain circuit like professor.
